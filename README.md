In this DIY project, we've created a smoke detection system using Arduino, combining technology and simplicity to enhance safety. Here's a quick overview:

Components:
Arduino Uno:

The brain of the system, responsible for processing data from the smoke sensor and controlling the buzzer.
Smoke Sensor:

A specialized sensor designed to detect the presence of smoke particles in the air.
Buzzer:

An alarm that is activated when smoke is detected, alerting you to potential fire hazards.
Li-ion Battery:

Provides a portable power source for the system, ensuring it remains functional even during power outages.
Type C Charging Module:

Enables convenient and fast charging for the Li-ion battery, making the system easy to maintain.
Switch:

A simple switch to turn the system on or off manually.
Casing:

A sleek and protective casing for the components, giving the project a polished and professional look.
Functionality:
Smoke Detection:

The smoke sensor continuously monitors the surrounding air for smoke particles.
Arduino Processing:

The Arduino Uno processes the data from the smoke sensor, determining whether the smoke levels are above a set threshold.
Buzzer Activation:

If smoke is detected, the buzzer is activated, emitting a loud and distinctive sound to alert you to potential danger.
Switch Control:

The switch allows you to easily turn the system on or off, providing flexibility in its use.
Li-ion Battery Power:

The project is powered by a Li-ion battery, making it portable and resilient to power interruptions.
Charging Module:

The Type C charging module ensures a hassle-free and quick way to recharge the Li-ion battery when needed.
Safety in Style:

The components are housed in a stylish casing, making the smoke detection system not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.
